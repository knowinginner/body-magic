WE DO NOT NEED MAGIC TO TRANSFORM OUR WORLD. WE CARRY ALL OF

THE POWER WE NEED INSIDE OURSELVES ALREADY.

J.K. ROWLING

IF I HAVE SEEN FURTHER, IT IS BY STANDING ON THE SHOULDERS OF GI-

ANTS.

1676 LETTER OF ISAAC NEWTON

WE TAKE THE VERY BEST OF WHAT PEOPLE DO, SYNTHESISE IT DOWN,

MAKE IT LEARNABLE AND SHARE IT WITH EACH OTHER. AND THAT IS WHAT

THE REAL FUTURE OF WHAT NLP WILL BE AND IT'S GONNA STAY THAT WAY!

THE EVOLUTION ISN'T OVER. WE ARE THE EXPERIENCE THAT THE UNI-

VERSE IS HAVING.

ALL WE ARE EVER DOING IS PUTTING THINGS TOGETHER OR TAKING

THINGS APART.
